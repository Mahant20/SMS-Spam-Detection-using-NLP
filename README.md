## The accuracy of the models are as follows:-
### 1) Dense Network
### 2) Bi-LSTM
### 3) LSTM
Different steps included in the project are :- <br>
    Load and explore the spam data<br>
    Prepare train test data<br>
    Train the spam detection model using the three approaches mentioned above<br>
    Compare and select a final model<br>
    Use the final trained classifier to classify the new messages<br>
